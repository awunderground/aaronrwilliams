I believe in the power of evidence and understanding to change lives. But building that evidence is tough work. Through trial and error, I've developed a firm belief and demonstrated expertise in code-first data analysis. And, I am passionate about sharing industry leading techniques and tools for code-first data analysis. 

My name is Aaron R. Williams and I am a data scientist and public policy professional. I am a Senior Data Scientist at the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/), an Adjunct Professor in the [McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/) at Georgetown University, and a freelance statistics and data science instructor.
