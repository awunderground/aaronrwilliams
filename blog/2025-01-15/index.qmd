title: Ten Semesters at Georgetown University
---

I recently started my tenth semester teaching in the [McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/). My first job after graduating from Virginia Commonwealth University was tutoring athletes in statistics and economics. Since then, teaching has always been one of the most rewarding activities of my life. 

I'm lucky to work with so many great professors at Georgetown including my colleague from the Urban Institute, Alena Stern. 

Alena, Gabe Morrison, and I have organized our course notes from Intro to Data Science and Advanced Data Science into a Quarto book that will always be freely available online ([website](https://awunderground.github.io/data-science-for-public-policy2/), [source files](https://github.com/awunderground/data-science-for-public-policy2)). It's a work-in-progress but I hope you find it enjoyable and useful!
