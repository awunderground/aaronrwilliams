I lead the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/) R Users Group and teach around the Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia areas. I offer full-day and half-day on-site workshops about introduction to R and data visualization in R. 

Please contact me at aaronrwilliams100@gmail.com if you want more information or if you would like to schedule a workshop.
